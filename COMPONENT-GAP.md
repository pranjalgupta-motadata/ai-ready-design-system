# Component Gap — merged library vs Storybook

What the four product design systems actually built, checked against what exists in this
Storybook today.

**Source:** the merged comparison library at `design-systems/merged/` — every component from four
systems, matched by type:

| System | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Org Mgmt | Om Vekariya |
| IAM | Kaivalya Pandit |
| Agent Fleet | Keertan Zala |
| Credential | Harshil Thesia |

**Audited:** 28 July 2026. Foundations (colour, typography, radius/elevation/spacing, icons) are
excluded — this is components only, from Button onwards.

---

## The short version

| | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Component rows in the merged library | 42 |
| Fully covered in Storybook | **16** |
| Partially covered | **4** |
| Missing entirely | **22** |

**Storybook covers about 38% of what the four teams actually built.**

The gap is not evenly spread. Forms, overlays and navigation are in good shape. **Data display and
feedback are almost empty.**

---

## How to read the priority

The most useful signal in this data: **how many of the four teams independently built the same
thing.** If all four built it without talking to each other, it is not optional.

| Built by | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 4 of 4 | Universal need. Build first. |
| 3 of 4 | Strong need. |
| 1–2 of 4 | Product-specific. Probably not core. |

---

## ✅ Covered — 16

| Merged row | Built by | Storybook component |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Button | 4 | `Button`, `ButtonGroup` |
| Icon button | 3 | `Button` (`size="icon"`) |
| Field wrapper | 3 | `Form` + `FormField` / `FormLabel` / `FormMessage` |
| Text input | 2 | `Input`, `InputGroup` |
| Select · Search input · Textarea | 3 | `Select`, `Combobox`, `Input`, `Textarea` |
| Checkbox · Radio · Switch | 4 | `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Switch` |
| Status pill | 4 | `TagPill` |
| Chip / meta pill | 4 | `TagPill` |
| Data table | 4 | `Table` |
| Pagination bar | 1 | `Pagination` |
| Toast | 2 | `Toast` |
| Tabs | 3 | `Tabs` |
| Sidebar navigation | 4 | `Sidebar` |
| Menu / popover | 3 | `DropdownMenu`, `Popover`, `HoverCard` |
| Modal | 4 | `Dialog` |
| Drawer | 3 | `Sheet` |

---

## ⚠️ Partial — 4

Something close exists, but it is not the same component and would need work.

| Merged row | Built by | What exists | What's missing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Choice chip group | 2 | `ToggleGroup` | Chip styling and multi-select behaviour |
| Segmented control | 2 | `ToggleGroup`, `Tabs` | The segmented visual treatment |
| Card · Section header · Divider | 2 | `Separator` only | **`Card` and section header do not exist** |
| Key-value rows | 2 | `Item` | The label/value pairing layout |

> **Correction:** an earlier version of this file listed **Radio card** as missing. It is not —
> `Radio` ships `variant: card` and `card-with-radio`, and `Checkbox` ships the same. That was a
> component-level comparison missing a variant-level fact, which is exactly the failure mode the
> next section exists to catch.

> **Worth flagging:** the README's very first example imports `Card`. There is no `Card`
> component. That code does not work.

## ❌ Missing — 22

Ordered by how many teams built it.

### Built by all four — build these first

| Merged row | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **KPI / stat tile** | Every team built one. Dashboards are core to all four products. |
| **Banner** | Every team built one. Only `_internal/DeprecationBanner` exists, and it is not exported. |

### Built by three

| Merged row | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Avatar & avatar stack** | No avatar of any kind in Storybook |
| **Micro-label & count badges** | `TagPill` is not a count badge |
| **Empty state** | Nothing exists |
| **Wizard stepper** | Nothing exists |

### Built by two

| Merged row | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Progress meters & bars | `Skeleton` and `Spinner` are loading, not progress |
| Code / mono wells | Font tokens exist; the component does not |
| Contextual strip | Inline contextual messaging |
| High-risk action gate | Confirm-before-destructive pattern |
| Tag input / removable chip | `TagPill` renders a pill but cannot be typed into |

### Built by one

| Merged row |
| --- |
| Toggle setting row |
| Test status label |
| Protocol & store badges |
| Icon tile |
| Secret dots |
| Inline editable field |
| Activity timeline |
| Tree row |
| Unsaved changes bar |
| Page header |

*(Two further rows — "Zero-drift extraction wins" and "Module component layer" — are audit
findings rather than components, and are not counted.)*

## Variant gaps — the component exists, the variant doesn't

A component counting as "covered" does not mean it can do what the four teams needed. These gaps
sit *inside* components Storybook already has, and they are the easiest kind to miss.

Storybook's variants were read straight out of the CVA definitions
(`node scripts/extract-variants.mjs`) — 26 components, 91 variant groups, 317 values.

### Button — 5 missing variants

| Variant | Org Mgmt | IAM | Agent Fleet | Credential | Storybook |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| primary | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| secondary | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| ghost | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| danger / destructive | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| link | ✅ | — | ✅ | — | ✅ |
| **ai** | ✅ | — | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **tertiary** | ✅ | — | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **dangerGhost** | ✅ | — | ✅ | — | ❌ |
| **warning** | ✅ | — | ✅ | — | ❌ |
| **mono** | — | — | ✅ | — | ❌ |
| outline | — | — | — | — | ✅ *(only here)* |

**`ai` and `tertiary` were each built by three of four teams independently.** Those are not
product quirks — they are missing from the library.

`ai` is a genuinely distinct treatment (Org Mgmt renders it as `✦ Ask AI`), not a recolour of
`primary`. Given the whole point of this project, an AI action button arguably belongs in the
system regardless of the count.

Storybook is ahead in other directions: `shape` (square/rounded/pill/circle), `elevation` (0–3),
sizes `xs`/`xl`/`icon` and an `active` state appear in none of the four systems.

### TagPill — variants are colours, not meanings

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Storybook | `default, yellow, blue, green, red, purple, orange, pink, teal, cyan` |
| The four systems | success, warning, danger, info, neutral — **semantic tones** |

This is the most structurally significant gap in the file. Colour-named variants cannot be
re-themed and carry no meaning: `red` does not tell an AI tool, or a developer, that this is an
error state. IAM's expiry map (`never` / `soon` / `expired`) is called out in its own audit as
"the one fully-tokenized map" — that is the model to copy.

Also missing: **the status dot.** Credential's status pill renders a coloured dot before the
label; `TagPill` has no dot.

### Input

| Variant | Systems | Storybook |
| --- | --- | :-: |
| invalid | Credential | ✅ as `hasError` |
| with icon | Credential | ✅ via `InputGroup` |
| **mono** | Credential | ❌ |

`mono` also appears on Agent Fleet's status pill and table cells — it looks like a system-wide
need for monospaced data display, not a one-off.

### Checkbox · Radio · Switch

Broadly covered, and better than the source systems in one respect: IAM's audit records **four
contradictory disabled treatments** and **three different radio implementations** across its own
codebase. Storybook has one of each, plus `card` variants on both `Checkbox` and `Radio`.

The one gap: `Switch` exposes only `size`. The systems show explicit on/off/disabled states.

---

## What Storybook has that the merged library doesn't

Not everything is a gap in one direction. These exist here and appear in none of the four systems:

| Component | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| `Command` | Command palette |
| `OTPInput` | One-time code entry |
| `Tooltip` | Notably absent from all four systems |
| `ScrollArea`, `Resizable` | Layout primitives |
| `Container`, `Flex`, `Grid`, `Stack` | Layout system |
| `Skeleton`, `Spinner` | Loading states |
| `Toolbar`, `Item`, `Toggle` | — |
| `Icon` | 500+ icons, already tokenised |

This is real ground already won. The merged library is four product teams' needs; Storybook is a
library. It is reasonable for it to hold primitives none of them named.

---

## Recommended order

| Order | Component | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Card** + section header | Blocks the most other work, and the README already claims it exists |
| 2 | **Banner / Alert** | All four teams built one |
| 3 | **KPI / stat tile** | All four teams built one |
| 4 | **Avatar** + stack | Three teams; nothing close exists |
| 5 | **Badge** (count / micro-label) | Three teams; `TagPill` does not cover it |
| 6 | **Empty state** | Three teams; cheap to build |
| 7 | **Wizard stepper** | Three teams; more involved |
| 8 | Progress | Two teams |

**Cards first.** Almost every other missing component — stat tile, empty state, key-value rows,
activity timeline — sits inside one.

---

## A note on method

This compares component **types**, not implementations. Where four teams built the same type, they
almost certainly built it four different ways — different padding, different states, different
naming. Picking a winner per row is a design decision, and the merged library's own "choose the
best variant, then save" flow is built for exactly that.

The count above says what is missing. It does not say which team's version to keep.
